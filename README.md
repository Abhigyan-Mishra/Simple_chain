## Intro

The blockchain is a fascinating technology, but it can also be intimidating. At the time I wrote this code, I had consumed a lot of material regarding the blockchain and cryptocurrencies, but I hadn't satisfied my hunger for knowledge (and still haven't). I wanted to create my own blockchain for some of that knowledge to sink in, and I wanted it to be simple. Simplechain is the result of that, and I hope you find it as helpful as it was for me when I created it.

## Usage

First, clone the repo:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/olistic/simplechain.git
$ cd simplechain
```

Then, install the dependencies:

```sh
$ npm install
```

And finally, launch the REPL:

```sh
$ npm start
```

_Voilà!_ If you see the `SIMPLECHAIN>` prompt, it means you're inside the REPL.

Go ahead and try the following commands:

* `ADDBLOCK <data>`: Mines a block with the provided data and adds it to the chain.
* `LISTBLOCKS`: Lists all the blocks in the chain.

Well done! If you want to learn more, please don't forget to [look at the code](https://github.com/olistic/simplechain/tree/master/lib).

## Advanced Usage

### Adjust Difficulty

If you want to tweak the blockchain's difficulty, you can do so via the CLI:

```sh
$ npm start -- --difficulty <number>
```

This number represents the amount of zeros the hashes of the blocks in the blockchain need to begin with. A greater number makes it more difficult (more computationally expensive) to mine a block.

## Next Steps

* Implement P2P network of nodes where:
  * Miner nodes broadcast mined blocks
  * User nodes broadcast data to be included in blocks by miners
* Implement peer discovery protocol so nodes can find each other
